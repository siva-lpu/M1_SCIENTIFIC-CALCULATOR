Modern scientific calculators generally have many more features than a standard four or five-function calculator, and the feature set differs between manufacturers and models; however, the defining features of a scientific calculator include

Arithmatic functions
Scientific functions
Trigonometric Functions
Matrix Function In this miniproject we implenting some of those features using C programming which will operate on both Windows and Linux operating systems.

 ## Research
 Research paper The Scientific calculator doesn't involve any complex operations or any operations. It is easy to apply the values in the system to find the required result rather than remembering and applying it in formula. Thus by studying all these facts, the necessary functions has been implemented to get the required results in a better way.
 
 ## Cost and Features
 Depending upon the project how well it is built and all the requirements will meet the cost and it can be varied according to the market
 
Addition : sum() takes two values as input and returns x+y
# Subtraction : substraction() takes two values as input and returns x-y
